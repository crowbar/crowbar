# This script expects to be able to run certian commands as root.
# Either run it as a user who can sudo to root, or give the user
# you are running it as the following sudo rights:
# crowbar-tester ALL = NOPASSWD: /bin/mount, /bin/umount, /usr/sbin/debootstrap, /bin/cp, /usr/sbin/chroot

# When running this script for the first time, it will automatically create a
# cache directory and try to populate it with all the build dependencies.
# After that, if you need to pull in new dependencies, you will need to
# call the script with the --update-cache parameter.  If you are going to
# develop on Crowbar, it is a good idea to put the build cache in its own git
# repository, and create a branching structure for the packages that mirrors
# the branching structure in the crowbar repository -- if you do that, then
# this build script can be smarter about what packages it should pull in
# whenever you invoke it to build an iso.

# Source OS specific build knowledge.  This includes:

# OS = the distribution we are staging on to, such as redhat or ubuntu.
# OS_VERSION = the version of the distribution we are staging on to.
#              For redhat, it would be somethibng like 5.6
# OS_TOKEN = Defaults to "$OS-$OS_VERSION"
# ISO = the name of the install ISO image we are going to stage Crowbar on to.
# PKG_TYPE = The package type we should look for in crowbar.yml for OS
#            specific packages.
# PKG_ALLOWED_ARCHES = The allowed package arches we will look to stage.
#                      These are usually whatever the OS equivalent of
#                      amd64 and all are.
# CHROOT_GEMDIR = The location that the OS keeps its gem cache in.
# CHROOT_PKGDIR = The location that the OS keeps its package cache in.
# Functions that build_crowbar needs to call:
# find_cd_pool(): This function should echo the current location of the
#   package pool on $ISO when it is mounted on $IMAGE_DIR.
# fetch_os_iso(): This function should try to fetch the OS iso from
#   a well-known location on the Internet, and die if it cannot.
# chroot_update(): This function should ask the chroot to update its
#   package metadata.
# chroot_install(): This function should try to install the packages passed
#   to it as args.
# chroot_fetch(): This function should ask to download (but not install)
#   the packages passed to it as arguments and all their dependencies.
# add_repos(): This function should try to add repositories passed to it
#   as args to the chroot environment.
# is_pkg(): This function should check to see if the string passed to it
#   is a valid package filename.  The file need not actually exist.
# pkg_name(): This function should extract the package name and arch as the
#   package management system will see them from the file passed as an argument,
#   and echo that information in $name-$arch format.
# __make_chroot(): This function should handle all of the OS-specific actions
#   needed to set up the package-fetching chroot environment.
# final_build_fixups(): This function should take wahtever steps are needed
#   to make the default OS install process also ensure that the Crowbar bits
#   are properly staged and to completly automate the admin node install
#   process, either as an install from CD or an install via PXE.  This
#   usually entails modifying initrd files, adding kickstarts/install seeds,
#   modifying boot config files, and so on.
# add_offline_repos(): This function should take whatever steps are needed
#   to ensure that the OS packages in the crowbar build cache are installable
#   from the chroot environment.
