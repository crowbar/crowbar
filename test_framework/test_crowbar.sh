$0: Crowbar test framework.
I smoketest Crowbar to ensure we have certian minimal functionality.

Arguments:
   cleanup: Will try to clean up from any previous runs that
            exited abnormally.
   develop-mode: Causes the framework to pause instead of automatically
                 exiting whenever a test fails, a timeout is exceeded, or
                 the test would otherwise exit sucessfully.
   pause: Causes the framework unconditionally pause after all the tests
          have finished.
   pause-after-admin: Causes the framework to pause after the admin node
                      has been deployed.
   admin-only: Only deploy an admin node -- do not spin up compute nodes.
   xtra-args <parameter>: Additional parameters wich will be passed to smoketest tool.
   manual-deploy: By default, the framework will automatically launch the
                  crowbar install once the admin node is up using a default
                  name of admin.smoke.test.  Passing manual-deploy causes
                  the framework to not do that.
   use-iso <path-to-iso>: This tells the framework what iso to use to try
                          to use to deploy Crowbar from.
   <barclamp name>: Deploy and run any applicable smoketests for <barclamp>.
   help: Display this help

VM Specifications:
   By default, the smoketest framework will try and deploy a 5 node cluster.

   The admin node will have 4 CPUs, 4 gigs of RAM, 1 hard drive with
   15 gigs of disk space, and 2x E1000 nics.

   The compute nodes will have 2 CPUs, 2 gigs of RAM, i hard drive with
   10 gigs of space for the OS, 2 hard drives with a gig of space,
   and 2x E1000 nics.

Networking:
   The smoketest framework creates 2 bridges, and attaches one nic from each
   VM to each bridge.  The primary bridge is given an IP address of
   192.168.124.1, and the framework assumes that it can contact the admin node
   at 192.168.124.10.

   The framework will also inject the public key of the user running the
   smoketest into all of the deployed nodes to enable passwordless SSH access
   to all the public interfaces on all the deployed nodes.

Logging and Display:
   By default, the smoketest framework will arrange for all the VMs to log
   to a serial capture, which is saved in $CROWBAR_DIR/testing.  This is also
   where error output from the scripts are captured, the VM images and state
   information is saved, etc.  The framework also runs a screen session to
   display various important logs, provide a shell running in the same
   environment as the framework, and (if the DISPLAY variable is not present
   in the environment) to provide access to the consoles of the vms.
   If DISPLAY is set, the VMs will run using an SDL display.
