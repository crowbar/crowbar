This file documents dev, the workflow helper tool for Crowbar
development.

dev is designed to help automate the workflow and infrastructure
related tasks associated with development in general with the Crowbar
git tree layout.  Dev is designed around the following assumptions:

 * Everyone has their own forks on Github of the Crowbar repository
   and all of the barclamps.
 * You do not have to manually keep submodule references up to date.
 * Your development workflow will involve regular synchronization
   against the dellcloudedge repositories.
 * The only path for getting code into the dellcloudedge repositories
   is via pull request.

Requirements:

 * A checkout of Crowbar.
 * Bash 4, ruby, rubygems, and the json gem.
   If running under Windows, make sure that all these operate in your
   cygwin or msysgw enviromnent.
 * A github username and password.

Day to Day Workflows:

Initial Setup:

 1: Clone the Crowbar repository from
    https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar.git.
 2: Run crowbar/dev setup.
    a: Provide your github login ID and password.  Dev will need it to
       to handle takling to Github.
    b: dev will create any missing forks of the dellcloudedge Crowbar
       repositories.
    c: dev will add a remote named personal to each forked repository.
    d: dev will add git config entries describing how local changes
       will be backed up to each repository.
 3: Create your local build cache.  See README.build for more
    information.
 4: Re-run setup any time you need to pull in a new barclamp, or if
    you need to use non-Github remotes for additional functionality.

Regular Development:

 1: Run dev fetch followed by dev sync to fetch and merge changes from
    the dellcloudedge repositories.
    a: Dev will fetch all changes from all upstream remotes for all
       repositories.
    b: Dev will attempt to synchronize all the local branches with
       their corresponding remote branches.  If there are merge
       conflicts, the sync process will stop at the branch that was
       having problems.  From there, you can manually fix the
       conflicts and rerun dev sync.
 2: Run dev new-feature <featurename> to start working on a new
    feature.
    a: This command shold be run from the development release.
    b: Dev will create branches in the feature/<featurename> namespace
       in the main Crowbar repository and in all the barclamps.  The
       initial starting point for these branches will be the tips of
       the corresponding branches in the development namespace.
 3: Hack/build/test/commit.
 4: Run dev backup to back up your changes.  This force-pushes your
    changes to your personal forks of the crowbar repositories on
    Github, or creates new personal branches for non-Github upstreams.
 5: If you are not ready to create a pull request for your changes, go
    to 1.

Ready for pull request:

 1: Run dev pull-requests-prep
    a: dev will verify that all the local Crowbar repositories are
       "clean".
    b: dev will perfom a fetch and a sync, and abort if there were any
       merge conflicts.
    c: dev will figure out what barclamps and what main Crowbar
       branches are candidates for a pull request in the current release.
    d: dev will print a command line wil all the branches and
       barclamps that are candidates for pull requests in the current release.
 2: Run dev pull-requests-gen
    a: dev will ask for a title to be used for all the pull requests.
    b: dev will open an editor for you to type in a body that will be
       used for all the pull requests that will be generated.
    c: dev will work out the proper order that a reviewer will need to
       merge the pull requests in based on barclamp submodule and
       branch dependencies.
    d: If submodules are being updated, dev will create the commit
       records needed to point the main Crowbar branches at the proper
       submodule commits.
    e: dev will issue pull requests in the order worked out
       earlier. Each individual pull request will have a sequence
       number added to the title indicating the proper merge order.
    f: Github will email the review team at Dell with each pull
       request.

Review pull request:

 1: Dell reviewer is notified of the pull request by Github.
 2: Reviewer reviews and tests pull requests as a group.
 3: If the changes are OK to be pulled, reviewer merges them in order.


Release Branching Structure:

The dev tool has the notion of a release, which it manages in terms of
related branches.  Currently implemented release types are:

 * Development which consists of the top-level branches tracked
   branches in the Crowbar repository (master and its descendents),
   and the master branch in each of the barclamps.
   Development is where the day-to-day development on new features and
   bugfixes happens.
 * Releases, which consist of branches prefixed with release/<release
   name>/ in the main Crowbar repository and in the
   barclamps. Releases are named with a unique name (similar to Ubuntu
   or Debian release names), and only get stabilization and bugfix updates.
 * Feature bundles, which consist of branches prefixed with feature/<feature
   name>/ in the main Crowbar repository and in the barclamps.
   Features are local to your private forks and personal branches, and
   get merged the main dellcloudedge repositories via pull requests to
   the appropriate development branch in the appropriate dellcloudedge
   repository. For now, feature branches should always be based on and
   merged back into the development release.
 * Stable, which consists of branches prefixed with stable/ in the
   main Crowbar repository and in the barclamps.  The details of how
   the stable release will work is TBD.

Release Workflows:

Getting a list of known releases:

 1: Run dev releases

Getting the release you are currently on:

 1: Run dev release

Switching to a different release:

 1: Run dev switch <release name>
    a: dev will verify that the crowbar repositories are "clean", and
       it will refuse to do anything if they are not.
    b: dev will checkout the appropriate master branch for the release
       in all the barclamps.
    c: If there is a branch that matches the one you are on in the
       main Crowbar repository, dev will check that branch out,
       otherwise it will check out the master branch in that release.

Cutting a new release:

  1: Ensure that all the crowbar repositories are in the exact state
     you want the new release to start out in.
  2: Run dev cut_release <new release name>.
     a: dev will verify that the release name is not already in use in
        the current repository.
     b: dev will create the master branch for the new release in each
        of the barclamps.
     c: dev will create a branch structure for the new release based
        on the branch structure of the current release.

Managing non-dellcloudedge repositories:

The dev script has the capability of integrating local or private
forks of Crowbar into its workflow.  To do this, you will need to
add the following pieces of information to your $HOME/.build-crowbar.conf:

 * Add any local branches to the DEV_BRANCHES hash.  This hash defines
   the parent -> child relationships between branches:
   DEV_BRANCHES["child"]="parent"
   Add one entry for each additional branch you want to track.  If a
   branch has itself for a parent it will be considered to be the root
   of a new branch hierarchy.
 * Add an entry in DEV_REMOTE_SOURCES for each additional remote
   you want the dev script to consider to be an upstream.  This hash
   has the following structure:
   DEV_REMOTE_SOURCES["remote"]="protocol://your_site/path/to/repos"
   The dev script expects to find a fork of the main Crowbar
   repository there, along with repositories for any extra barclamps
   you are pulling in as submodules.
 * Add an entry in DEV_REMOTE_BRANCHES to describe what additional
   branches each remote should be considered the "canonical" upstream
   of. Each entry should have the following structure:
   DEV_REMOTE_SOURCES["remote"]="branch another_branch"
 * Append your new remotes to the DEV_REMOTES array.  This array
   defines the order in which origins are consulted when performing
   fetch and backup operations

Once you have added all the extra data you need, rerun dev setup and
the script will fetch everything needed to satisfy the dependencies
that the new settings imply.

For example, the internal Dell branches of Crowbar need the following
additional config settings in $HOME/.build-crowbar.conf:
DEV_BRANCHES["openstack-build"]="openstack-os-build"
DEV_BRANCHES["hadoop-build"]="hadoop-os-build"
DEV_REMOTE_SOURCES["dell"]="ssh://our_gitolite_ip"
DEV_REMOTE_BRANCHES["dell"]="openstack-build hadoop-build"
DEV_REMOTES+=("dell")

dev currently assumes that origin in the main Crowbar barclamp will
always point at the dellcloudedge repositories, that the remote named
personal will always point at your github forks, and that it can
control the personal/<your_github_id>/ branch namespace upstream
remotes for any non-github repositories.

If your working circumstances involve not always having access to all
the remotes you have configured, you can set the DEV_AVAILABLE_REMOTES
environment variable to a list of remotes that are available.  dev
will only try to operate on remotes that it currently thinks are
reachable, but things will probably not work too well if origin gets
excluded.


Dev commandline options:

setup: Perform initial setup for the Crowbar repositories

    dev setup prepares the repositories to be managed by the dev
    tool. It handles caching your github credentials, ensuring that
    all of the barclamps get cloned and configured properly for fetch,
    sync, and backup operations.  It can be re-run nondestructivly if
    new barclamps are added or your local development environment
    needs to change.

is_clean: Tests to see if the crowbar repo trees are clean.

    Without any options, if any of the trees have uncommitted
    modifications to files under revision control, or there are any
    files present that are not under revision control that are not
    also ignored and that are not parts of a barclamp, this command
    will fail.  This command ignores submodule reference mismatches by
    default.

    With the --barclamps option, dev is_clean will not ignore
    submodule reference mismatches.

    With the --path option, dev is_clean will just check the locations
    you pass on the commandline for cleanliness.

fetch: Fetch updates to Crowbar and the barclamps from upstream.

    This command fetches updates for the main Crowbar repository and
    all the barclamps from all of the upstream repositories listed in
    the DEV_REMOTES array.  It does not make any modifications to the
    working trees.

sync: Sychronize local branches with their upstreams and local edits.

    This command assumes that remote changes have already been fetched
    into your local repositories using dev fetch.  Assuming that has
    been done, dev sync will perform the following operations:

    1: For each barclamp that is considered to be part of the current
    release, sync all the changes from the origin remote with the
    corresponding local branches for that barclamp.  If any merge
    conflicts are reported, dev will remember them for later.

    2: For each local branch in the Crowbar repository, sync that
    branch with the proper upstream branch. If any merge conflicts
    are detected, dev will exit with an error message.

    3: Ripple changes out from parent to child branches for this
    release.

    dev sync may use either a rebase or a merge to synchronize a local
    branch with its corresponding upstream.  This decision is made on
    a per-branch basis, and the algorithm that it uses is:

    1: Create a temporary branch that holds the state of the current
    branch we are looking at.

    2: Merge the upstream branch into the branchwe are looking at.  If
    that fails, we had a merge conflict which the user will have to
    resolve, and we abort.

    3: Switch over to the temporary branch, and rebase it onto its
    upstream branch.  If the rebase fails for any reason, abort it can
    decide to use the merged branch.

    4: Compare the working trees for the merged branch and the rebased
    branch.  If they are identical, use the rebased branch.  If they
    are not, use the merged branch.

backup: Backs up local commits to Github forks or personal branches.

    Use this command whenever you want to make sure your local commits
    are backed up to locations outside your local repositories.  By
    default, any branches in the main Crowbar repository or any
    branches in barclamps that originally came from the dellcloudedge
    repositories will be pushed to your forks of those repositories, and any
    branches in the main Crowbar repository or any branches in
    barclamps that came from somewhere else will be pushed to branches
    in the personal/github_login/ namespace in the proper upstream
    repostitories for that branch or barclamp.

push: Unconditionally push a branch to the personal remote.

    Use this command in the main Crowbar repository whenever you want
    to unconditionally push it to your fork on Github.  Any arguments
    are interpreted as branches to push, and if there are no arguments
    the current branch is pushed.

pull-requests-prep: Prepare the local repository to issue a pull request.

    This command will perform a fetch, a sync, and a backup
    operation.  If all those succeed, the command will then figure out
    what all barclamps and Crowbar branches in the current release
    have local commits, and it will print out a command line that can
    be used to have dev actually generate the pull requests.

    If the Crowbar repositories are in a feature release,
    pull-requests-prep will figure out what is needed to merge the
    feature branches into the development release.

pull-requests-gen:  Generate pull requests.

    This command creates a series of pull requests based on the
    command line arguments passed.  It will automatically include
    updated submodule references for the barclamps if needed, and if
    just barclamps are passed it will also figure out what branches in
    the current release need updates and generate requests for them as
    well.

    If the Crowbar repositories are in a feature release, the pull
    requests will be generated against the corresponding branches in
    the development release.  This enables feature releases and pull
    requests to form the basis of gated-trunk style development.

release: Shows the current release of Crowbar based on git branches.

releases: Show all the releases that dev knows how to work on.

switch: Switch from one release to another.

    This command checks out the appropriate release branch in all the
    barclamps for the release you are switching to, and then checks out
    the branch that most closely corresponds to your current branch in
    the release you are switching to.  If you do not pass a release, it
    will check out everytthin for the current release instead.

build: Build a release of Crowbar.

    Despite the name, build mainly concerns itself with setting the Crowbar
    repositories up before invoking build_crowbar.sh to perform the actual
    build.  The build command takes the following parameters:
    --os = operating system to stage Crowbar on to.
    --release = Release of Crowbar to build.
    --branch = Branch within a release of Crowbar to build
    --exact = If present, dev will run git submodule update after processing
               the --release and --branch options, and the --no-cache-update
                and --no-metadata-update parameters will be passed to
                build_crowbar.sh.  If not present, the submodules will be
                checked out to the appropriate master branch for the release.
    Any other parameters will be passed unchanged to build_crowbar.sh.
    See README.build for more details.

    If your build cache is managed by Git, and it has the same branching
    structure as the Crowbar releases, dev will switch to the appropriate
    branch in the build cache before invoking build_crowbar.sh.  This makes
    it easier to have seperate releases with known working sets of packages.

cut_release:  Cuts a new release based on the current state of Crowbar.

    Do not use this command unless you really know what you are doing.

new-feature: Creates feature branches for a new feature.

    Features are the primary method of working on new
    features/bugfixes/quasi-independent changes in
    Crowbar. They allow for gated-trunk style development in Crowbar
    by treating the development release as the trunk, and the feature
    releases as things that can be merged into the trunk via
    pull-requests on Github.

    Internally, features are implemented as a release type,
    so any dev command that works on releases will also work on
    features.

erase-feature: Erases feature branches created with new-feature.

    This command is intended to be run once a feature had been merged
    into the main development release -- once a feature has been
    merged, there is generally no point in keeping the branches around
    to clutter up your local git branches.

    erase-feature will check to see of the master branch of the
    feature branches has been merged with the master of the
    development release, and it will exit with an error if there are
    changes in the feature that have not been merged.

branches: Show the branches that are part of the current release

find-parent: Find the best logical parent of a feature bundle.

    This command tries to find the release that has the smallest
    number of commits that would have to be examined in order to merge
    the feature into it.  

reset-release: Reset a release or feature bundle.

    This command allows you to reset a release or feature bundle to
    the exact state it was in at either the last backup or from the
    upstream repositories.  It takes the following options:
    --release = The release or feature you want to reset.
    --target  = The state you want the release to be reset to.
       This can be either upstream (which will reset the branches to
       their corresponding remotes), or backup (which will reset the
       branches to their last backup).
    --skip-master - If present, this will cause reset-release to leave
       the master branch in the release alone.  It is implicitly set if
       you are resetting the current release.
    --skip-barclamps - If present, this will cause reset-release to
      leave the barclams alone.

    If run without any options, it will all
    the branches for the current release to the state they were in as
    of the last backup, except for the master branch of the current
    release in the crowbar repository, which will be left alone.

scrub-merged-pulls: Scrub tracking branches for pull requests

    Normally, you should not have to run this command, because it is
    implicitly run after every fetch.  However, if you have pull
    requests that were not merged in for whatever reason, your
    personal remote will slowly accumulate these branches.  To clear
    them all out, you can add the --all parameter, which will
    unconditionally delete all the pull request tracking branches.
