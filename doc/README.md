# Crowbar documentation

This is the index for all documentation within the Crowbar source
tree.  You can also find documentation in the [Crowbar
wiki](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/wiki).  The two should be
complementary: any documentation tightly coupled to code belongs in
the source tree, whereas information which is generally applicable
across all Crowbar releases can live in the wiki, although it does not
have to.  It is also worth remembering that documentation placed in
the source tree has the advantage of being accessible from a Crowbar
install even when there is no internet connection available.
