## Automated code analysis [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/crowbar/travis-ci-crowbar.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/crowbar/travis-ci-crowbar)

In addition to [automated testing and code coverage
reports](testing.md), we make use of the awesome service at
[codeclimate.com](https://codeclimate.com) to give us
[metrics on code complexity, smells, duplication etc.](https://codeclimate.com/github/crowbar/travis-ci-crowbar) across the whole Ruby codebase.  The badge above indicates
the current overall metric.
