#### Contributors

Contributor licenses protect you and the project!  They are designed to ensure that contributions to the project are open and not encumbered by licenses or other obligation.  They are not designed to limit you (the Apache license is very open) - they are for your protection.

We will accept small pushes and bug fixes without a CLA; however, we ask that you sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) if you plan to make regular or substantial code contributions.  The CLA is based upon the Apache 2 CLA.

CLAs:

* [Individual CLA](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/blob/master/license/Corporate%20Contributor%20License%20Agreement.pdf)
* [Corporate CLA](https://github.com/crowbar/crowbar/blob/master/license/Individual%20License%20Agreement.pdf)
