### User Interface (UI) Development

The Crowbar UI is a Ruby on Rails (RoR) application.  Unlike traditional RoR applications, each barclamp contributes components into the overall application.  This allows barclamps to extend the UI in tightly integrated ways; unfortanately, it can also be confusing.

The Crowbar UI framework provides some services including

1. documentation
1. menu
1. localization
1. default routes

It is important to understand how barclamps leverage the UI.  

There is a separate document on [how to test the web UI](testing/web-ui.md).
