# Crowbar 2.x Developers' Guide

Welcome to the amazing fuzziness of Crowbar!  This guide is targeted at people who want to extend Crowbar by adding new barclamps (aka modules). 

## Introduction
This document is a work in process!  Please update and then remove this tag when you feel that itâ€™s complete!

> _Caution!_ This guide is NOT designed for Crowbar 1.x.

### Authors:

* Rob Hirschfeld
* Greg Althaus
* Mike Pittaro
* Chris Dearborn

### Prerequisites

Before you start developing a barclamp, we recommend that you do the following:

*	Learn how to use Crowbar
*	Write down the manual steps needed to install your software
*	Create Chef Cookbooks to deploy your software

### General Information

#### Guidelines for Pull Requests

   * Must be Apache 2 license
   * For bugs & minor items (20ish lines), we can accept the request at our discretion
   * UI strings are localized (only EN file needs to be updated)
   * Does not inject vendor information (Name or Product) into Crowbar expect where relevant to explain utility of push (e.g.: help documentation & descriptions).
   * Passes code review by Dell Crowbar team reviewer
   * Does not degrade the security model of the product

   * Items requiring more scrutiny, including signing CLA 
      * Major changes
      * New barclamps
      * New technology

#### Timing

   * Accept no non-bug fix push requests within 2 weeks of a release fork
   * No SLA - code accepted at Dell's discretion. No commitment to accept changes.

#### Coding Expectations [PRELIMINARY / PROPOSED 8/31]
   * Copyright & License header will be included in files that can tolerate headers
   * At least 1 line comments as header for all methods
   * Unit tests for all models concurrent with pull request
   * BDD tests for all API calls and web pages concurrent with pull request
   * Documentation for API calls concurrent with pull request

#### Testing/ Validation

   * For core functions, push will be validated to NOT break build or deploy or our commercial products
   * For product suites (OpenStack, Hadoop, etc), push will be validated to NOT break build or deploy our commercial products
   * For operating systems that are non-core, we will _not_ validate on the target OS for the push (e.g.: not testing Suse install at this point)
   * For non-DellCloudEdge barclamps &ndash; no rules!
   * Eventually, we would expect that a pull request would be built and tested in our CI system before the push can be accepted

#### Feature Progression

The following table shows the progression of new feature additions to Crowbar. The purpose of this list is to help articulate how new features appear in Crowbar and when they are considered core.

Note: Features are NOT required to progress through all these phases! Architectural changes may skip ahead based on their level of impact and disruption.
