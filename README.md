# Crowbar Documentation README

_This is not the documentation you are looking for... it is a pointer to the real documentation._

## Looking for Crowbar Resources?

[The Crowbar project](https://github.com/crowbar/) is hosted on GitHub.

[The Crowbar website](http://crowbar.github.io) has links to all information and is our recommended starting place.

## Crowbar Documentation Organization

Crowbar documentation is maintained as part of the code, and is
versioned at the same time.  The core documentation is part of the
Crowbar barclamp. Individual Crowbar modules (aka "barclamps") also
include their own documentation.

All this documentation is included as online documentation when Crowbar is installed.

Here are commonly requested documentation references:

* [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-crowbar/tree/master/doc/gettingstarted.md)
* [User Resources](https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-crowbar/tree/master/doc/userguide.md)
* [Developer Resources](https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-crowbar/tree/master/doc/devguide.md)
* [Crowbar Release Management](https://github.com/crowbar/barclamp-crowbar/tree/master/doc/releases.md)

> You may need to look in subdirectories under the links above for additional details.

> Please, do NOT add documentation in locations besides /doc!  If necessary, expand this README to include pointers to important /doc information.
