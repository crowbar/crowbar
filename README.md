# Welcome to the Crowbar project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crowbar/travis-ci-crowbar_framework.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crowbar/travis-ci-crowbar_framework)

## What is Crowbar?

Crowbar is an Open Source platform for server provisioning and
deployment from bare metal. It provides server discovery, firmware
upgrades, and operating system installation using PXE Boot. It deploys
applications on top of functioning operating systems using chef.

## Where did Crowbar come from?

Crowbar was developed by the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team]
(http://dell.com/openstack) as an [OpenStack](http://OpenStack.org) installer,
but has evolved as a much broader orchestration tool.
