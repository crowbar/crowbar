# Keyboard settings for the text console

# e.g. KEYTABLE="de-latin1-nodeadkeys", "us" or empty for US settings
#
KEYTABLE="us.map.gz"

## Type:        integer
## Default:
#
# Keyboard delay time in ms (250, 500, 750, 1000)
KBD_DELAY=""

## Type:	string(2.0,2.1,2.3,2.5,2.7,3.0,3.3,3.7,4.0,4.3,4.6,5.0,5.5,6.0,6.7,7.5,8.0,8.6,9.2,10.0,10.9,12.0,13.3,15.0,16.0,17.1,18.5,20.0,21.8,24.0,26.7,30.0)
## Default:
#
# Keyboard repeat rate (2.0 - 30.0)
KBD_RATE=""

## Type:        list(bios,yes,no)
## Default:     bios
#
# NumLock on? ("yes" or "no" or empty or "bios" for BIOS setting)
KBD_NUMLOCK="bios"

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     no
#
# ScrollLock on? ("yes" or "no")
KBD_SCRLOCK="no"

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     no
#
# CapsLock on? ("yes" or "no")
KBD_CAPSLOCK="no"

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     no
#
# Disable CAPS LOCK and make it a normal Shift key?
# (Ctrl Caps Lock will still toggle Caps Lock functionality)
# Note that you need to tweak the xkb maps or use xmodmap
# if you want to do the same under X-Windows. In ~/.Xmodmap:
# keycode 0x42 = Shift_L Shift_L
#
KBD_DISABLE_CAPS_LOCK="no"

## Type:        string
## Default:     "tty1 tty2 tty3 tty4 tty5 tty6"
#
# ttys for the above settings 
# Example: "tty1 tty2"
# "" for all tty's
#
KBD_TTY="tty1 tty2 tty3 tty4 tty5 tty6"

# 
# Compose tables to be loaded.
# Compose tables are good for producing characters, which can not
#  be directly input from your keyboard, such as characters with
#  accents, currency signs, ...
# Please read /usr/share/doc/packages/kbd/README.SuSE for an
#  explanation.
# You may leave this variable empty (default compose table from kernel 
#  or KEYTABLE will be used then -- most keyboard maps don't have a
#  compose table, though)
# More than one compose table can be given. For a selection of possible
#  tables see /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/include/compose.*
# You can give more than one compose table, but only the last one will
#  determine the compose combinations.
#  The word "clear" has a special meaning:
#  Your compose table will be cleared, before more compose symbols are
#  added.
# The files compose.winkeys and shiftctrl may be used to map the 
#  <compose> key to the W*n menu key and Shift-Ctrl, respectively,
#  on a PC keyboard.
# A typical setting for Latin1 users (with a PC keyboard) may be
#  COMPOSETABLE="clear winkeys shiftctrl latin1.add"
# For latin2, this would be
#  COMPOSETABLE="clear winkeys shiftctrl latin2"
# A typical setting for sb. with a character set, where a matching 
#  compose table is missing (but with a PC keyboard), would be
#  COMPOSETABLE="winkeys shiftctrl"
# 
COMPOSETABLE="clear winkeys shiftctrl latin1.add"

# The YaST-internal identifier of the attached keyboard.
#
YAST_KEYBOARD="us,pc104"
