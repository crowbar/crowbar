  # Requires allows you to declare that this barclamp relies on
  # another barclamp to provide some of its functionality.
  # All barclamps implicitly rely on the crowbar barclamp.
  requires:
    - another-barclamp # rely on a single other barclamp
    - @barclamp-group  # rely on another group of barclamps.
  # Member allows you to declare that this barclamp is a member
  # of a group of related barclamp.  A barclamp can be a member of 
  # muliple groups, and a group name can be used instead of a barclamp
  # in a requires: clause by prefixing it with an @ sign.

  # Os_support allows you to declare that this barclamp only supports

  # systems it supports.

# debs, gems, rpms and extra_files allow you declare the OS packages,
# gems, and raw files that this barclamp needs.

# debs allows you to declare extra repositories to pull packages from
# and delare that packages that you need for systems that use Debian-style
# packaging.  
debs:
  # repos allows you to add an apt repository that the build system
  # should pull packages from.  Each entry is formatted in the standard
  # sources.list format.
  repos:
    # pull from internet: 
    # - deb http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian/ testing main
  # ppas allows you to declare Ubuntu personal package archives that 
  # the build should try to pull from.
  ppas:
    - ppa_username/ppa_name 
  # pkgs is a list of extra packages that the build system will try to pull
  # and cache on the crowbar iso image.  You only have to list top-level 
  # packages here -- if apt-get install gets all the dependencies, you do not
  # need to list them here.
  pkgs:
    # put your packages here
    # - mod_fcgid
  # raw_pkgs is a list of URLs to .deb packages that the build system will try
  # to download and add to the iso.  It does not do dependency checking, and
  # it uses curl to handle the actual download process.
  raw_pkgs:
    - http://your_site/your_special_deb.deb
  # You can have multiple OS specific sections as well.  You can declare
  # dependencies for repos, ppas, pkgs, and raw_pkgs here, and they will
  # be picked up when building Crowbar on that OS.

# rpms does the same thing that debs does, except for RPM-based systems.
rpms:
  repos:
    # rpm repos allow you to declare that you want to use a repo that
    # is set up using an RPM.  EPEL is a good example of such a repo.
    - rpm http://repo_addr/repo.rpm
    # bare allows you to declare that you want to use a repository that
    # does not allow easy installation via rpm.
    # It has a slightly more complex declaration:
    # bare repo_name numeric_repo_priority repo_url
    - bare epel5-nagios3 10 http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/peter/nagios3/epel-5/x86_64/ 
  pkgs:
    # put your rpms here
    # - httpd
  raw_pkgs: 
    - http://your_site/your_special_rpm.rpm
  pkg_sources:
    # This is designed to pull a .src.rpm for use by the rest of the build 
    # system.  It has the same restrictions that raw_pkgs does, with the
    # added restriction that you must also manually specify all the packages
    # needed to build this RPM in build_pkgs.
  os-token:
    # build_cmd is called after the rest of the packages and files have been
    # staged inthe build cache.  This script will be sourced by the build
    # system in a subshell, and should be written in bash.
    # Full documentation on how this works is in the README.build in the 
    # root of the main Crowbar repository.
    build_cmd: your_shell_script.sh
    
# gems allows you to declare the gems you need.
# Unlike the other package types, you can ask for a specific version of a gem
# The build system will solve dependencies as best it can, but if a gem you have 
# requires extra packages to install you will need to add them to the appropriate
# build_pkgs section of rpms and debs above.
gems:
  pkgs:
    # put your gems here.
    - i18n
    - rails-2.3.12 # Will try and pull rails-2.3.12 exactly.

# extra_files downloads and saves a file to be slipstreamed on to the 
# crowbar .iso in the extra/files directory (or a subdirectory thereof).
# The build system will try to extract the .rpm files from 
# anything that looks like an Oracle java rpm.bin and treat the extracted
# .rpm files as if they were provided by raw_pkgs. 
extra_files:
  # will place file into extra/files
  - http://some/file
  # will place file into extra/files/foo
  - http://some/file foo 
  # will place image.tar.gz in extra/files/ami.
  # For backwards compatibility, it will also be available at /ami
  - http://some/amazon/image.tar.gz ami 
  # Will download a java package and try to install its RPMS
  # if bulding Crowbar staged on Redhat.
