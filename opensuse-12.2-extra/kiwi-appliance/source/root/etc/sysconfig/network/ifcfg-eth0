## This is a template for a network interface configuration file used with ifup.
## See 'man 8 ifup' for details.
## Additionally to the following variables you can set every variable from the
## interface independent configurations files (config, dhcp, wireless) also in
## the interface configuration file to overwrite the global settings.

## Type: list(auto,hotplug,ifplugd,nfsroot,manual,off,onboot)
## Default: auto
#
# STARTMODE tells ifup when a interface should be set up. Possible values are:
# - auto:    start it as soon as the interface is available. Either when booting
#            or when a device is plugged or initialized at runtime
# - hotplug: alias for auto, only difference is that configurations with that
#            startmode are not considered to be mandatory if list of mandatory
#            devices is derived automatically.
# - ifplugd: interface will be controlled by ifplugd daemon. (If you like to use
#            multiple interfaces mutually exclusive you have to set also
#            IFPLUGD_PRIORITY.)
# - nfsroot: Nearly like 'auto'. But interfaces with this startmode will never
#            be shut down via 'rcnetwork stop'. 'ifdown <iface>' still works.
#            Use this when you have a nfs root filesystem.
# - manual:  start it only when ifup is called manually
# - off:     will not be started at all
# - onboot:  alias for auto, deprecated, only for backward compliance
STARTMODE=auto

## Type:    integer(0:100)
## Default: 0
#
# All interfaces with STARTMODE=ifplugd and with IFPLUGD_PRIORITY != 0 will be
# used mutually exclusive. If more then one of these interfaces is 'plugged'
# then we need a way to decide which interface to take up. Therefore we have to
# set the priority of each interface.
# Note: Connection detection of wireless devices is not very reliable.
# Therefore we currently simple consider a wlan interface as always connected.
# With a lower priority as all other interfaces it will then be set up if no
# other connection is established.
# A value of 0 means no priority set.
#
IFPLUGD_PRIORITY=

## Type:    list(static,dhcp,autoip,dhcp+autoip,6to4)
## Default: static
#
# With BOOTPROTO you can choose in which mode the interface will be set up:
# - static:      Set up static address(es)
# - dhcp:        Start a dhcp client on that interface.
# - autoip:      Automatic search for a free address and assign it statically.
# - dhcp+autoip: Try dhcp and use autoip if dhcp fails.
# - 6to4:        Set up ipv6 over ipv4 tunnel (see man ifcfg-tunnel)
# If you use dhcp or autoip you may additionally specify static address(es).
#
BOOTPROTO=static

## Type:    string
## Default: ""
#
# If using a static configuration you have to set an IP address and a netmask

# 3) IPADDR=192.168.1.1/24     # NETMASK and PREFIXLEN will be ignored
#
# For multiple addresses use this variable multiple times and extend them with

### FIXME:
### From here one up to 'bridge settings' the file is not up to date


## Multiple addresses
##    You can extend the variable name 'IPADDR' by any string you like (IPADDR_1,
##    IPADDR_FOO, IPADDRxxx, ...) and use these variables for your IP addresses.
##    If you need some additional parameters for these addresses, then just add
##    the same extension to these variable names.
##    IPADDR_AAA=1.2.3.4
##    NETMASK_AAA=255.0.0.0
##    BROADCAST_AAA=1.2.3.55
##    IPADDR_BBB=10.10.2.3/16
##    LABEL_BBB=BBB
##    an so on ...
##
## You do not need to set a label for any address. But then you should not use
## ifconfig any longer; go and use ip. If you want to use ifconfig then omit the
## label for your main address and set a label for every additional address.

## Routing:
## If you need special routes for a configuration, then use a file named
## ifroute-<config> where <config> is the same string as in ifcfg-<config>.
## It has the same syntax like routes except one difference:
## If you omit the interface name (4th field) in the ifroute file it will be
## set to the current interface name when setting up the interface. You need to
## do this with hotpluggable devices, where you do not know which interface name
## they will get at the time when you plug them.
## See man 5 routes.

## DHCP settings

## Type: list("",yes,no)
## Default: ""
#
# Multiple DHCP clients:
#
# With two or more DHCP clients running, they would concurrently try to replace
# the default route or rewrite resolv.conf, rewrite ntp.conf etc. There are two
# ways of dealing with this conflict (and it is a conflict, because you can
# have only one default route even though routes are stackable, and there can
# only be one resolv.conf file):
#
#  1) allow both clients to do that stuff. This would work in many cases if
#     only one of the interfaces is used at a time. However, it would lead to
#     undefined behaviour.
#
#  2) allow only one of the DHCP clients to do that stuff. This implies
#     that there would be a "primary" interface and a "secondary". This is the
#     assumption the default configuration is based on. But since the system
#     can't guess which interface is "more important" and should have the
#     default route and resolver configuration associated with it, it simply
#     chooses the first interface that is started with DHCP to be
#     "authoritative".  Which one that is can be influenced by adding
#     DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE=yes to one of the /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*
#     files. This can even be added to more than one file, to achieve the
#     behaviour described in 1).  Thus, there is the flexibility to do it
#     either way.
#
# Per default, only the DHCP client that is started first will be allowed to
# change the default route / resolver configuration etc.  All other running
# clients will only configure the interface with an address, but not change
# "global" configuration.
#
# Thus, to specifically allow an interface's DHCP client to change "global"
# configuration, set the following variable to "yes". Or you can make an
# interface's DHCP client never change these settings if you set it to "no".
# If you leave it empty then ifup-dhcp will decide.
#
DHCLIENT_PRIMARY_DEVICE=


## Type:
## Default:
