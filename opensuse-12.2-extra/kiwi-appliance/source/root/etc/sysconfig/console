## Description:	Framebuffer configuration
## Type:	string
## Default:	""

# You may want to load a framebuffer display driver into your kernel
# in order to be able to change graphics modes etc. with fbset in
# console mode.
#
# Notes: Most people won't enter anything here, as:
#   * it won't work if you have vesafb already active
#   * its advantageous to have fb support compiled into your kernel
#   * Some XFree86 drivers (especially in XFree86-4.x) don't work
#     too well, if you enable framebuffer text mode.
#
# Example:
#  FB_MODULES="matroxfb_base vesa=0x182 fv=85 matroxfb_maven matroxfb_crtc2"
# 
FB_MODULES=""

## Type:        string
## Default:     ""
#
# In case your kernel has framebuffer support (or you loaded the framebuffer
# support into your kernel as a module above), you may want to change the
# resolution or other parameters. This is done by secifying the parameters
# to fbset. Use a mode from /etc/fb-modes and additional parameters as
# -a, -depth <BPP>, -vyres <VYRES>, ... (See fbset manpage and/or fbset -h).
#
# Notes:
#   * vesafb does not (currently) support changing the display mode
#   * BEWARE! Don't set modes your monitor can't do. Watch out for the maximum
#     horizontal frequency. Old monitors might even be damaged if you exceed 
#     their capabilities.
#
# Example:
#   FBSET_PARAMS="-a -depth 16 768x576-90 -vyres 10240"

# Note: The KBD_TTY setting from Hardware/Keyboard (sysconfig/keyboard)

# Load this console font on bootup:

# 
CONSOLE_FONT="lat9w-16.psfu"

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
#
# Some fonts come without a unicode map.
# (.psfu fonts supposedly have it, others often not.)
# You can then specify the unicode mapping of your font 
# explicitly. (/usr/share/kbd/unimaps/)
# Normally not needed.
#
CONSOLE_UNICODEMAP=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
#
# Most programs output 8 bit characters, so you need a table to
# translate those characters into unicode. That one can be specified
# here. (/usr/share/kbd/consoletrans/)
# (Note: If your console is in utf-8 mode you don't need this.)
# If your code does not use a unicode mapping at all (because you
# e.g. explicitly specified UNICODEMAP="none") you may circumvent
# the translation via unicode, but load a map which directly maps
# 8 bit output of your program to a font position.
#
CONSOLE_SCREENMAP=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
#
# for some fonts the console has to be initialized with CONSOLE_MAGIC.
# CONSOLE_MAGIC can be empty or have the values "(B", ")B", "(K" or ")K".
# Normally not needed (automatically handled by setfont).
